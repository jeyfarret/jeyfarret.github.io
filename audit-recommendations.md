# ðŸ”’ Cybersecurity Audit Recommendations for Botium Toys

Following the internal IT audit of Botium Toys, the following control and compliance-related recommendations are provided to reduce risks and strengthen the organizationâ€™s security posture:

---

## 1. Enforce Stronger Administrative Controls

**Recommendation**: Implement a formalized password policy requiring strong, complex passwords that are regularly updated.

**Rationale**: Weak passwords are a common attack vector (e.g., brute-force attacks). A strong password policy is a basic, yet critical, preventive control.

---

## 2. Deploy Technical Security Controls

### a. Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
**Recommendation**: Deploy an IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious or unauthorized activity.

**Rationale**: Early detection of anomalous behavior helps prevent data breaches and enhances incident response time.

### b. Data Encryption
**Recommendation**: Use end-to-end encryption for sensitive data in storage and transit (especially payment and PII data).

**Rationale**: Encryption protects data integrity and confidentiality, especially during online transactions.

---

## 3. Improve Physical Security

**Recommendation**: Install CCTV surveillance and ensure all server rooms and sensitive storage areas have adequate physical locks.

**Rationale**: Physical safeguards deter unauthorized access and support post-incident investigations.

---

## 4. Address Asset Management Deficiencies

**Recommendation**: Implement an asset inventory system and conduct regular audits to track IT hardware and software assets.

**Rationale**: Proper asset management supports compliance, budgeting, patching, and incident response.

---

## 5. Align with Compliance Standards

### a. GDPR
**Recommendation**: Ensure that all data collected from EU citizens is stored, processed, and accessed in compliance with GDPRâ€”including breach notification within 72 hours.

**Rationale**: Failure to comply with GDPR could result in substantial fines and reputational damage.

### b. PCI DSS
**Recommendation**: Review and enhance credit card data security in accordance with PCI DSS controls.

**Rationale**: Compliance with PCI DSS protects both the company and its customers from data breaches and fraud.

---

## 6. Apply the Principle of Least Privilege

**Recommendation**: Restrict user permissions based on job roles. Regularly audit access privileges.

**Rationale**: Minimizing unnecessary access limits the damage caused by compromised accounts.

---

## 7. Implement Separation of Duties

**Recommendation**: Design internal processes so that no single employee has complete control over critical functions (e.g., finance or system admin).

**Rationale**: Reduces the risk of insider threats and accidental misuse.

---

## Final Thoughts

These recommendations are based on the NIST CSF, OWASP security principles, and regulatory best practices. By addressing these areas, Botium Toys can significantly reduce risk, protect sensitive data, and build a secure foundation for continued global expansion.
